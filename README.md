The human can interact with the any real time object (Machine) with five senses i..e sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch.
There are several ways to face the HMI challenge, in this case - hand gestures focused to control the system operations. (Bluetooth,optical gloves,motion technologies) - increase in cost and decrease in hardware.
Our approach is using embedded systems (Arduino),thus decreasing cost but increase in hardware.
The hand gestures are sensed by the ultrasonic sensor to execute the computer applications. . In this system, ultrasonic sensor is directly interfaced with the computer.
The laptop can easily be operated from small distances and up to the range of pre-programmed distances. No external hardware is required to read and control some external peripherals.
